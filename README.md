# VoiceTest Andrés Muñoz test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

## Application Set Up
1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Run the application with command `ng serve`

## Work Logs
- Create source code repository. (5 minutes)
- Clone the repository. (5 minutes)
- Create base project by `ng new`command. (Relative from CLI)
- Check on microservice integration, in this stage my objective was to understand the request-response communication, what do this URI response on payload and headers for content management on Front End application. (15 minutes)
- Check on requirements and how 'providers' response payload would fix on them. (10 minutes).
- Base project's components and styles. (30 minutes)
- TroubleShooting by finding the way to retrieve each actor's sample audio. For this task it was necesary to navegate on each voice123 window and test a specific attribute retrieved on payload `relevant_sample` to deduce wich one would be the correct URI. (15 minutes)
- Select the strategy or design pattern, and implement code to show actors information on FrontEnd. (130 minutes).
- Lunch and break Time. (60 minutes)
- Pagination strategy and codification. (60 minutes)
- Audio player implementation. (30 minutes)
- ReadMe documentation. (30 minutes)
## Future improvements
### Own Project.
- My solution does not fixed the entire requirements, I just miss the hightlighted search text, I really dont remember how do I add directives from my search keyword so I was limited to concatenate with original text.
### Voice Test.
- It would be nice for us as developers to have the service's swagger docuementation, so that, It would be easier to have to know the request-response definitiones and have a faster development on coding.
